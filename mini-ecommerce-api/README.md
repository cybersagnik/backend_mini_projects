 A simple yet secure E-Commerce Backend API built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication.
 This project is designed for learning, and as a foundation.

##  Features
- Authentication & Security

- JWT-based user login/registration

- Password hashing with bcrypt

- Products Management

- Add, list, and manage products

- Stock management on orders

- Orders System

- Create orders with multiple products

- Auto total calculation with 5% platform fee

## Clean Architecture

- Modular routes, models, and middleware

- Easy to extend

## Tech Stack

- #### Backend:Node.js, Express.js

- #### Database:MongoDB (Atlas) with Mongoose ODM

- #### Auth: JWT + bcrypt

- #### Dev Tools: Nodemon, Postman for testing

## Getting Started
1. Clone Repository
   - `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-ecommerce-api.git`
   - `cd mini-ecommerce-api`

3. Install Dependencies
`npm install`

4. Setup Environment Variables

5. Run Server
`npm run dev # runs on http://localhost:5000`

## API Endpoints
- Auth Routes
  - ``POST /api/auth/register → Register new user``
